Goal: Make a Shiny app
Needs to:
	- wrangle data and display in friendly format
	- predict data
	- user friendly UI
	- make it look pretty
	
Need to hand in:
- live link to shinyapp
- link to video explaining my app
- project readme detailing the app

Raw data:

https://www.transtats.bts.gov/OT_Delay/OT_DelayCause1.asp

Travel throughput 2019~2021
https://www.tsa.gov/coronavirus/passenger-throughput


arr_flights 			-- total count of flights
arr_del15 				-- total count of delays
- it looks like count numbers need to be rounded to whole numbers
carrier_ct 				-- count of delays from air carrier
weather_ct 				-- count of delays from weather
nas_ct 					-- count of delays from national aviation system
security_ct 			-- count of delays from security
late_aircraft_ct 		-- count of delays from late arriving aircraft
arr_cancelled 			-- count of cancelled flights
arr_diverted 			-- count of diverted flights
### which means ontime count is arr_del15 + (arr_cancelled + arr_diverted)
arr_delay 				-- number of mins flights are delayed
carrier_delay 			-- number of mins delayed caused by air carrier
weather_delay 			-- number of mins delayed caused by weather
nas_delay 				-- number of mins delayed caused by national aviation system
security_delay 			-- number of mins delayed caused by security
late_aircraft_delay 	-- number of mins delayed caused by late arriving aircraft



Shiny dashboard:
https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/structure.html

Some data display ideas:
- bar plot showing percent delayed in a year
	- select which years to show
	- select whether to display 'arrival counts', 'delay counts', 'percent delayed'
	- can use prediction to predict delayed flights in the future
	- need to look into prediction using python
	- implement natural log
	
- number of delays for an airport at a given time - grouped by causes
	- bar chart of delay causes for a given time 
	
- scatter plot (of a year) showing percentage of delay flights vs likelihood of a cause of delay, each dot size is by total count of flights

	- 

- box plot of airline delay from years 2004 - 2020
	- use total delay count 
	- can switch to delay percent out of all arriving flights
	- show mean, 25%, 75% percentiles
	- display standard deviation
	
- map displaying where the airports are - hover and show statistics
	- need small circle blue markers
	- need marker labels that display on mouse hover 

- display raw data table
	- select box to choose which data to display
	
	
5 min video:
- my name, group of 1
- what I made
- data from: US bureau of transportion
- motivation: detailed visualization of flight delays
- libraries used:
	- shiny app
	- shinydashboard instead of flexdashboard, more flexibility, adheres to shiny coding conventions
	- tidyverse: dplyr, ggplot, stringr
	- plotly: make pie chart
	- leaflet: make map
	- htmltools, rcolorbrewer
- total flights delayed
- delay by cause
- delay by airport
- delay by year
- map 
- raw data
- thank you
